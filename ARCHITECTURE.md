# AutoScientist AI — Architecture Documentation

> **"From Raw Data to Evidence-Based Scientific Discovery."**

---

## 1. Executive Overview

**AutoScientist AI** is an autonomous scientific discovery and data science platform. It transforms raw datasets into rigorous, evidence-backed scientific discoveries using deterministic, reproducible computations in Java and presents them through an interactive React dashboard.

Key Architectural Tenets:
- **Zero Hallucination / No Fabricated Results**: Every correlation, ANOVA, p-value, decision tree, or quality score is calculated from real dataset observations.
- **Strict Separation of Correlation & Causation**: All findings, hypotheses, and reports enforce scientific integrity, preventing unwarranted causal claims.
- **Self-Contained Full-Stack**: Built entirely with Java 17+ (Spring Boot 3) on the backend and React (Vite, Bootstrap, Chart.js) on the frontend. No Python dependencies.

## 3. Core Analytical Pipelines

### 3.1. Statistical Association Pipeline
1. **Numeric + Numeric**:
   - Drops rows with missing values in either column concurrently (paired alignment maintained).
   - Computes Pearson correlation $r = \frac{\sum (x - \bar{x})(y - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum (x-\bar{x})^2 \sum (y-\bar{y})^2}}$.
   - Derives $t = r \sqrt{\frac{n-2}{1-r^2}}$ and two-tailed p-value via Student's t-distribution.
   - Calculates effect size ($r^2$, variance explained) and confidence interval.
2. **Numeric + Binary Categorical**:
   - Splits numeric values by group.
   - Computes Welch's unequal variances t-test (robust against heteroscedasticity).
   - Computes Cohen's $d$ effect size.
3. **Numeric + Multi-Class Categorical**:
   - Executes One-Way ANOVA across all non-empty classes.
   - Calculates F-statistic, p-value via F-distribution, and Eta-squared ($\eta^2$).
4. **Categorical + Categorical**:
   - Constructs two-way contingency table.
   - Computes Pearson Chi-Square ($\chi^2 = \sum \frac{(O-E)^2}{E}$).
   - Computes Cramer's $V$ for effect magnitude.

### 3.2. AutoML & Model Explainability
- **Data Splitting**: Strict 70% Train, 15% Validation, 15% Test partitioning to eliminate data leakage.
- **Standardization & Preprocessing**: Transformers fitted exclusively on training splits and applied to validation/test sets.
- **Algorithms**:
  - Regression: Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Decision Tree Regressor.
  - Classification: Binary/Multinomial Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest.
- **Explainability**: Permutation Feature Importance evaluated on validation splits; normalized importance scores; model weights and odds ratios.

### 3.3. Scientific Report & Evidence Provenance
- Findings are structured as an Evidence Graph where findings trace back to exact statistical tests, datasets, preprocessing versions, and model runs.
- PDF generation compiles metadata, charts, data quality matrices, and scientific narratives using OpenPDF.
